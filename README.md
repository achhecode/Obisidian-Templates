## How to use any template

### Please ensure the plugins are installed in obsidian, most likely below or more
1. Dataview
2. Templater
3. Excalidraw

### Create a new files `Template-name` inside folder `Templates`

Note: You can choose any name of the file or the folder, Generally it is recommended to use Templates folder for create any templates.

##### Paste the template code in the `Template-name` file or just download the templates and put the `Template-name` files in `Templates` folder.

### We have 2 options to create the template: 

1. Template hotkeys
2. Startup templates


Setup and use hotkeys (for my case `ctrl+Shift+D`) for creating the templates. Additionally, you can also create hotkeys for inserting the template if needed.

Note: Using hotkeys will create a `untitled` file with log message `Something ....`

If you setup a template in `Startup template` it will automatically run the script and create the file every time you open obsidian.
Note: No worries, for most of the files code written in such a way that if file for that day already exists it will not create or modify it.


### Happy Coding
